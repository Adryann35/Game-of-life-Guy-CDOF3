# Game of Life

## ðŸ“– Project Description

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state and follows a set of simple rules. This console-based implementation displays the game in the terminal using `#` for live cells and spaces (` `) for dead cells.

### Features:
- Randomly initialized grid of live and dead cells.
- Dynamic simulation of the game's evolution based on Conway's rules:
  1. A live cell survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors.
  2. A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors.
  3. All other cells die or remain dead.
- Clear and interactive terminal display.
